## Getting started with the code

As said in the README, this project is using [yarn](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360) to manage js dependencies, [electron](http://electron.atom.io) to make a build for any OS and [MIDIFile](https://github.com/nfroidure/MIDIFile) to read and manipulate MIDI files. If you know music, some javascript and worked with node in some level, this project should be easy to understand.

To get a quick understanding of how MIDI files work, I recommend reading [this](http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/express/issue18/midifilespart1.html).
